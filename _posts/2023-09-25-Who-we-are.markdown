Greetings! We are a team made by students of Videogames Design & Development of Videogames on the spanish university [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](https://www.urjc.es). This is currently our fourth year.

In this post you will be introducted to the team and his most disposable work.

# The team

The team is composed by six people, in which we all contribute to almost every area. This is because we all are really multi-disciplinar, even if we have specialized on our favorite topic.
